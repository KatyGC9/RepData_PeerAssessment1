## Loading and preprocessing the data from the github repository
```{r, echo = TRUE}
unzip("activity.zip")
activitydata <- read.csv("activity.csv")
summary(activitydata)
```

##Make data more readable by transforming dates and ascertaining number of missing data
```{r, echo = TRUE}
library(lubridate)
activitydata$date <- ymd(activitydata$date)
summary(activitydata)
```

## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?

##Calculate total number of steps per day
```{r, echo = TRUE}
stepstotalday <- aggregate(steps ~ date, activitydata, sum, na.rm = TRUE)
print(stepstotalday)
```
## Make a histogram illustrating total number of steps per day
```{r, echo = TRUE}
hist(stepstotalday$steps, main =  "total steps per day", xlab = "steps per day")
```
## Calculate mean and median of total steps per day
```{r, echo= TRUE}
mean(stepstotalday$steps)
```

```{r, echo = TRUE}
median(stepstotalday$steps)
```


## What is the average daily activity pattern?

##Create a time series plot of the 5-min interval as the x-axis and average number of steps taken averaged over days as the y-axis
```{r, echo = TRUE}
intervalsteps <- aggregate(steps ~ interval, data = activitydata, mean, na.rm = TRUE)
plot(steps~interval, data = intervalsteps, type = "l")
```

##Answer the question: Which 5-minute interval, on average across all the days in the dataset, contains the maximum number of steps?

##Extract this answer with the which.max function
```{r, echo=TRUE}
maxsteps <- intervalsteps[which.max(intervalsteps$steps),]$interval
maxsteps
```


## Imputing missing values

##Calculate and report number of missing values in this data set
```{r, echo=TRUE}
missingmissing <- sum(is.na(activitydata$steps))
print(missingmissing)
```
                  
##Strategy: fill in the mean per interval as a substitute for all NA. Extract mean per interval
```{r, echo = TRUE}
meaninterval <- function(interval){intervalsteps[intervalsteps$interval==interval,]$steps}
```

##Make a new data set filling in the missing data with the means extracted from the above function
```{r, echo=TRUE}
datasansNA <- activitydata 
for (i in 1:nrow(datasansNA)){if(is.na(datasansNA[i,]$steps)){datasansNA[i,]$steps <- meaninterval(datasansNA[i,]$interval)}}
head(datasansNA)
```

##Make a new histogram with this filled in data set, showing total number of steps taken each day
```{r, echo=TRUE}
newsteps <- aggregate(steps ~ date, datasansNA, sum)
hist(newsteps$steps, main = "histogram of steps with no missing data")
```
##Extract mean and median for this new set
```{r, echo=TRUE}
mean(newsteps$steps)
```

```{r, echo=TRUE}
median(newsteps$steps)
```


## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
##Create a new factor variable in the dataset with two levels – “weekday” and “weekend” indicating whether a given date is a weekday or weekend day.
```{r, echo=TRUE}
datasansNA$NewDate <- as.Date(datasansNA$date, format = "%Y-%m-%d")
datasansNA$weekday <- weekdays(datasansNA$NewDate)

datasansNA$Days <- ifelse(datasansNA$weekday=='Saturday' | datasansNA$weekday=='Sunday', 'weekend','weekday')

head(datasansNA)
```
##Make a panel plot containing a time series plot (i.e. 𝚝𝚢𝚙𝚎 = “𝚕”) of the 5-minute interval (x-axis) and the average number of steps taken, averaged across all weekday days or weekend days (y-axis).

```{r, echo=TRUE}
stepsweekdays <- aggregate(steps ~ interval + Days, datasansNA, mean)
names(stepsweekdays) <- c("interval", "day", "steps")
library(lattice)
xyplot(steps ~ interval | day, stepsweekdays, type = "l", layout = c(1, 2), 
    xlab = "Interval", ylab = "Number of steps")
```
